A library for drawing Unlinear Graphs

## Gradle Setup

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
	...
	maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.vk59:GraphView-Library:2.0.1'
}
```

## Quick start
#### 1. Firstly, you have to declare a variable of GraphData type. It's necessary to show your data correctly.
The first parameter is ArrayList of Moments (every Moment contain X and Y coordinate of the point on Graph).
But it isn't necessary to fill the ArrayList right now (but you can)
```java
private graphData = new GraphData(new ArrayList<Moment>, Color.rgb(61, 244, 165), "Graph â„–1");
```

#### 2. OK, it's pretty easy. Then we have to fill our GraphData with Moments. It's easy too:
```java
graphData.addData(X, Y);
```

#### 3. There is float variable  X and Y. Or you can add several data using this method:
```java
graphData.setData(arrayListOfMoments);
```

#### 4. Now we are going to draw our data in the GraphView.
Of course, before that you have to add GraphView to your layout and find that in the code.
```java
private GraphView graphView = findViewById(R.id.graphView);
graphView.addGraphData(graphData);
graphView.drawGraph();
```
That's all! Your graph is on the display.

#### 5. If you want to clear your graph, write 
```java
graphView.clear;
```
Now graphView forget about all the GraphData objects. Of course, your Data is still saved (in graphData variable). You can add new Moment and draw that again.

#### 6. If you want to draw several graphs, you should declare several GraphData variables and add that to GraphView:
```java
graphView.addGraphData(graphData);
graphView.addGraphData(graphData2);
graphView.addGraphData(graphData3);
```

## Examples of using

This library generally was used in the 'ISC' application. You can see the code [here](https://github.com/infolab-club/isc)
